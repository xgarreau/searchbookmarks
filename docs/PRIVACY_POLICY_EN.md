# Privacy Policy - Search Bookmarks

**Last updated: November 28, 2025**

## Introduction

Search Bookmarks (hereinafter "the Extension") is a browser extension designed to help you quickly search through your bookmarks. We take your privacy very seriously.

## Data Collection

**The Extension does NOT collect ANY personal data.**

Specifically:
- ❌ No data is collected
- ❌ No data is transmitted to external servers
- ❌ No data is sold or shared with third parties
- ❌ No trackers or analytics systems are used
- ❌ No cookies are created or used

## Permissions Used

The Extension requests the following permissions:

### "bookmarks" Permission
- **Why?** To read your bookmarks and enable searching
- **How?** Read-only access to your favorites list locally
- **Where?** All data remains in your browser
- **Modifications?** The Extension never modifies your bookmarks

## Data Processing

All Extension operations happen **locally in your browser**:

1. **Reading bookmarks**: Your favorites are read directly from your browser
2. **Search**: Search is performed locally using JavaScript
3. **Display**: Results are shown only in the Extension popup
4. **Navigation**: Clicking a result simply opens the URL in a new tab

**No data leaves your device.**

## Favicons

The Extension displays favicons (site icons) using Google's public service:
`https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=[domain]`

This request contains only the domain name (not the bookmark title or full URL). This is a standard feature used by many extensions.

If you prefer not to use this service, you can modify the Extension's source code.

## Local Storage

The Extension does not use any storage system (localStorage, chrome.storage, etc.). All data is loaded on demand from the browser's Bookmarks API.

## Updates

This privacy policy may be updated occasionally. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date at the top of this document.

## Source Code

The Extension is open-source and its code can be inspected at any time:
- Via your browser's developer tools
- By viewing the Extension files in `brave://extensions/`

## GDPR Compliance

The Extension is GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliant because:
- No personal data is collected
- No data processing occurs outside your device
- You maintain full control over your data

## Contact

- Leave a review on the Extension page
- Open an issue on the GitHub repository (if applicable)

## Summary

**In brief:**
- ✅ Everything works locally
